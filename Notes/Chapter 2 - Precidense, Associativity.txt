Precedence of * is higher than that of - .
Hence, the multiplication is performed before subtraction,
and the value of myInt will be 4.

Associativity specifies the order in which operators are executed,
which can be left to right or right to left.
For example, in the phrase a = b = c = 8,
the assignment operator is used from right to left.
It means that the value 8 is assigned to c,
then c is assigned to b, and at last b is assigned to a.
